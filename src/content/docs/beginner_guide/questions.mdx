### Why use Linux over macOS?

> The closed nature of the Apple ecosystem makes macOS inaccessible to most of the desktop users in the world. Many of the points mentioned in Windows section apply here too.

## Why are you so obsessed with an operating system?

> Linux is a niche. The idea of Linux promotes privacy and freedom in software in general, however it is not much known outside of the circle. Many people want to promote Linux to the world, and many do so in different ways. You could say this "obsession" is a way of doing that. Be reminded though that not every Linux user is obsessed with Linux!
