## Overclocking

:::danger
While overclocking can bring some benefits for gaming in general, it is not recommended for the average user unless you are fully aware of what you are doing, and you know the potential consequences of overclocking.
Overclocking can burn out your graphics card and make it unusable, so only use it to increase performance by a little. (~1.5x or under is a safe-ish range)
